# Heads up!
- **There is slight cussing. I have went in and censored parts of the cussing for your safety.**
- **There are a lot of references to other games.**
- **Sadly, there's not a WIKI yet.** :(
## Thank you for reading. Now let's talk about the real stuff.
### This mod adds:
- A new structure, which has a low chance to spawn.

- A gamerule which if it is enabled, a new command is able to be used. It's for lore sake, chill out people. (/startdetectivemode)

- A **TON** of advancements for you to collect. Some of them relating to me [DevEngie].
- Armor to help you stay alive longer.
- Ban Hammers(Which are the swords FYI). They do a lot of damage the more better you find/craft.
- My own scythe(Weaker than the biggest ban hammer availible).
- If paired with AAE Mobs, it's a lot easier to get certain items instead of having to find the singular structure.

~~I also have no care if you just dip this, I just want to show off my modding skills.~~ <- **This is a joke by the way. I really do care if you download this.** Oh and I have been working on this since **2019**. I'm only deciding to upload this now.
